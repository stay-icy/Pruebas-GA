    <h1 class="universal">¿Who's Yoshi?</h1>
        <p class="pr"> <strong>YOSHI</strong> is a dinosaur-like character that acts as an ally of Mario and Luigi and is the protagonist of his own franchise. Among members of the Yoshi species hailing from Yoshi's Island, any Yoshi may be identified as the "Yoshi" character, and as such, not all iterations of the character are necessarily the same one.</p>

        <p class="pr">According to the Super Mario World manual, he got his name from Yoshi's Island because he was first discovered there. In the <strong> Super Mario series</strong>, he often acts as a rideable character for the heroes, while in most of the spin-off games, he is a playable character on his own. Yoshi's defining traits include his cutesy appearance, his cheerful and friendly personality, his flutter-jumping and egg-laying abilities, his rideability as a steed, and exclaiming his own name.</p>
